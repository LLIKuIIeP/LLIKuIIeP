I am deeply passionate about reverse engineering and automation, with a particular focus on analyzing and manipulating software and web applications. 
My expertise lies in using tools like IDA Pro and JADX to dissect and understand the inner workings of various programs. 
I enjoy the challenge of uncovering hidden functionalities, optimizing processes, and creating automated solutions to streamline tasks. 
Whether it's breaking down complex systems or developing scripts to automate repetitive actions, I thrive on solving problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world. 
My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field, contributing to innovative projects and sharing my insights with the community.
